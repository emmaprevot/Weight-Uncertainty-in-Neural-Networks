# Weight-Uncertainty-in-Neural-Networks


This project aimed at replicating the main results of Blundell et al. in their paper "Weight Uncertainty in Neural Networks" from 2015. Some extension to Regression and Classification are also provided, as well as a relevant medical application.

The code was inspired and expanded from https://github.com/saxena-mayur/Weight-Uncertainty-in-Neural-Networks
